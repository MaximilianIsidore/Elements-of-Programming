# Elements-of-Programming

### This repository contains my personal attempts to solve problems and exercises from the book "Elements of Programming Interviews" by  ADNAN AZIZ, TSUNG-HSIEN LEE, AMIT PRAKASH . As I work through the book, Iâ€™m focusing on learning core algorithms and data structures by implementing solutions in three major programming languages: C++, Python, and Java. The solutions are based on my understanding of the material, and while I use the book for reference and guidance, the code does not mirror the exact solutions from the book.
